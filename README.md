# go
The first code project in my life written in C, using modified, by our professor, library conio2. 

The project is called "Go" - ancient Chinese table game. How-to-play manual is built-in, but to generally know what's going on, I recommend
to read about it on Wikipedia or somewhere on YT.

Again, this is my FIRST ever project, and I know it's not the best code-wise, but I decided to upload it to show the progress I made for these months I've been studying :D
